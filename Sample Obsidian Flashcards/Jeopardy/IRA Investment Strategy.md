It depends on your tax rate. A cardinal rule is that early on in someone's career, they will generally have a lower tax rate than later on in their career, when they are more likely to be making more money. In retirement, folks tend to have a lower tax than the tax rate at the peak of their income.

Generally speaking, a [[Roth IRA]] is better earlier in your career because you are more likely to have a lower tax rate. It depends on many variables, but your tax rate in retirement depends on how much your wealth will be taxed. With lower income and little savings, paying taxes up front may be lower than paying taxes when you retire. The reverse is true later in your career, if you are making more money then. In that case, a [[Traditional IRA]] is likely more beneficial because it will allow you to pay taxes when you withdraw from the fund in retirement, which is when you likely have a lower tax rate.
